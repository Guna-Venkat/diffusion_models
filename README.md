# Diffusion Models Research Repository

This repository is dedicated to my research journey in **diffusion models**, with a focus on understanding, comparing, and synthesizing key techniques and applications from recent papers. The goal is to build a strong foundation for writing a research paper and preparing presentations for academic discussions.

## Repository Structure

```
research/
  └── [All collected research papers in PDF]
detailed-notes/
  └── [In-depth notes for each paper, including key ideas, methods, results, and shortcomings]
short-notes/
  └── [Concise summaries of each paper, suitable for quick review or sharing on social media]
```

## Purpose
- **Collect** and organize relevant papers on diffusion models and their applications.
- **Deeply study** each paper, documenting main contributions, techniques, and limitations in the `detailed-notes` folder.
- **Summarize** each paper in the `short-notes` folder for easy reference and to track progress publicly (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram).
- **Prepare** for presentations and future research by comparing and synthesizing ideas across papers.

## How to Use
- Add new papers to the `research/` folder.
- For each paper, create a corresponding detailed note in `detailed-notes/`.
- After completing detailed notes, write a short summary in `short-notes/`.
- Use these notes to prepare presentations or share progress updates.
